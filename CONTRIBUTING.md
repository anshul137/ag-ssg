## What should I know before I get started?

Static site generator which converts the.txt or .md file to static .html page. In this version of project we need to create the command line tool which will help to process the .txt or .md file to .html files.

## Requirements

```
cd <project_name>
npm install
```

- Run the npm link module

```
npm link
```

- Build and run the project

```
node app.js - command line arguments
For example
node app.js - i "test.txt" .
if the file is in particular folder we have to provide the path like this  node app.js -i "./textfile/Silver Blaze.txt"
if you want to convert the whole folder text file to  html use this command node app.js -i textfile
```
